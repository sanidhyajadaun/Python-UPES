## **1. Basic Data Types**

Q1. WAP to read the record of n students in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name: [marks]. Print the average of the marks obtained by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places. <br>
Input Format <br>
The first line contains the integer n, the number of studentâ€™s records. The next n lines contain the names and marks obtained by a student, each value separated by a space.<br>
Sample Input<br>
3 <br>
Krishna 67 68 69 <br>
Arjun 70 98 63 <br>
Malika 52 56 60 <br>
Sample Output <br>
56.00 <br>

Q2. WAP to input a list of scores for N students in a list data type. Find the score of the runner-up and print the output.<br>
Sample Input <br>
N = 5 <br>
Scores= 2 3 6 6 5 <br>
Sample output <br>
5 <br>


Q3. Rupal has a huge collection of country stamps. She decided to count the total number of distinct country stamps in her collection. She asked for your help. You pick the stamps one by one from a stack of country stamps. Find the total number of distinct country stamps using a suitable data type.

Sample Output<br>
2<br>


Q2. WAP to input the first name, middle and last name of a person. Your task is to print the initials of the first and middle name separated by a dot (.) <br>

Sample Input <br>
Mohandas KaramChand Gandhi <br>
Sample Output <br>
M.K. Gandhi <br>


Q3. Given a string containing both upper and lower case alphabets. Write a Python program to count the number of occurrences of each alphabet (case insensitive) and display the same. <br>
Sample Input <br>
ABaBCbGc <br>
Sample Output <br>
2A <br>
3B <br>
2C <br>
